# responsive-portfolio

## Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework

In this project, the goal was to create a responsive portolio for oneself. Bootstrap was a required component of this portfolio. This project still has many tiny kinks that need to be worked out.

The biggest problem in this project has been portfolio.html. Getting the cards to work as expected has proved quite a challenge for not only me, but my tutor as well.
